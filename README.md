# Welcome to Aziza's Record Store!

This is a single-page project built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This was assigned during week 5 of Momentum's 16-week Full-Stack Bootcamp. 

## How Does It Work?

Users are prompted to "Search for Music" by entering a song title, artist, or album title in the search bar at the center of the page. 

At the completion of the search, the results populate in the middle of the page, with each result showing the album cover, song title, and artist. When the user hovers over any one song, the surrounding box will darken to make reading the details easier. 

If a song is selected, the "Currently Playing:" area will populate with the song title and artist name. To really emulate the feeling of being in a record store, a few songs before the song preview plays, a brief sound of a record scratching will play before the song! The results of a previous search will clear when prompted by a new search.

This assignment was in the beginning of my learning how to use Javascript, and I'm really proud of how I pushed the envelope and added that record-crackle sound! Learning how to use sound and add a Timeout to time each sound correctly was a great challenge. This peaked my interst in front-end development and I'm always excited to keep learning.

Thank you for checking out my Record Store!
